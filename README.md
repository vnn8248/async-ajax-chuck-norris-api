# async-ajax-chuck-norris-api

## Front-end
Skeleton css was used for styling. The number input will correspond to the amount of Chuck Norris Jokes that are returned from a Chuck Norris Joke API (http://www.icndb.com/api/). XML HTTP Request was used to make the call just to practice the basics.

## Live server
VS Code extension Live Server was added. The server is launched from the index.html file and will auto-refresh on each save.
